					<h4>The Humanitarian Exchange Language</h4>				
					<p class="text-small">The Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL) is a simple standard for messy data. Use HXL hashtags to speed up data processing and create interoperability across data sources.</p>
					<p class="text-small"> HXL was developed for humanitarians, by humanitarians. It takes into account the specific challenges humanitarians face in collecting, processing, and sharing data as well as the tools that humanitarians actually use to do their work.</p>
					<p class="text-small">While that is all well and good, you are probably asking yourself "what will HXL actually help me do? Why should I care about HXL?" In this section, we will tell you why you should care about HXL.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="HXL_benefits" data-menu-title="Benefits of HXL" name="HXL Benefits">
					<h4>Benefits of HXL</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">The HXL data standard was designed to make working with messy humanitarian data more efficient and effective. As a humanitarian, HXL can help if:
						<ul class="text-small">
							<li>you feel bogged down by repetitive, manual workflows;</li>
							<li>you are looking for ways to reduce errors when preparing, cleaning, and merging data;
							</li>
							<li>you want to quickly and easily be able to know what data is in a given dataset;
							</li>
							<li>you have ever dreamed about producing reusable dashboards and quickly whipping up new visualisations; and 
							</li>
							<li>you put your blood, sweat and tears into producing high quality data and you want to make sure other people can use it. 
							</li>
						</ul>

				<section id="Automate_Workflows" data-menu-title="Automate Data Workflows" name="HXL Benefits">
					<h4>Automate Data Workflows</h4>
					<p class="text-small">Humanitarians spend an enormous amount of time and efforts manually copying, preparing, validating, and cleaning data. HXL was designed to transform repetitive, manual workflows to ensure that humanitarians can spend their time getting to insight.</p>

					<h4>Reduce Errors in Data</h4>
					<p class="text-small">It is easy to lose confidence in humanitarian data when it is riddled with many minor errors. We know that these errors are the result of overworked humanitarians who just do not have the time to spot them all.</p>

					<h4>HXL Hashtags</h4>
					<p class="text-small">The root of a HXL hashtag follows the same syntactic rules as a Twitter hashtag: it begins with the pound sign (“#”) and contains only unaccented Roman alphabetic characters (“a” to “z”), Arabic numerals (“0” to “9”), and the underscore symbol (“_”). </p>
					<p class="text-small">The core shared HXL hashtags describe high-level concepts like an organisation (#org), geographical coordinates (#geo), a humanitarian cluster or sector (#sector), the number of people affected (#affected), or a subdivision of a country (#adm1).</p>
					<h6>#inneed</h6>
					<h6>#population</h6>
				</section>
				<section id="HXL_ttributes" data-menu-title="HXL Attributes" name="Hashtags & Attributes">
					<h4>HXL Attributes</h4>
					<p class="text-small">The attributes of the HXL hashtag are used to specify characteristics. They do not carry complete information on their own and can only be understood when combined with the hashtag they are describing. </p>
					
					<p class="text-small">	HXL attributes start with “+” sign and always follow the hashtag that they describe. It is HXL compliant to add a space before the "+", but not after it. A hashtag may have any number of attributes, and order does not matter, so #org+funder+code has exactly the same meaning as #org+code+funder. 
					</p>
					<h6>+start</h6>
					<h6>+name</h6>
				</section>
				<section id="reusable_attributes" data-menu-title="Attributes Are Reuseable" name="HXL Basics">
					<h4>Attributes Are Reuseable</h4>
					<p class="text-small">HXL attributes are not tied to a single HXL hashtag. Think of them as adjectives that add descriptive details to the hashtag they describe.</p>
					<p class="text-small">The attribute "+children" can be combined with hashtags to describe the following unique variables:
						<ul class="text-small">
							<li><b>#population +children:</b> Number of children in the general population.</li>
							<li><b>#affected +children:</b> Number of children affected by the emergency.</li>
							<li><b>#inneed +children:</b> Number of children in need of humanitarian assistance.</li>

							<li>Add a new row between the last row of headers and the first row of data values.</li>
							<li>In your new row, add a HXL hashtag for each column you want to label.

								<li>Places: These include hashtags like #country, #adm3 and #geo. They are used when you have data on the administrative level or a geolocation.</li>
								<li>People and households: These include hashtags like #affected and #inneed. They are used when you have data about the people affected by the crisis and their needs</li>
								<li>Responses and other operations: These include hashtags like #org and #indicator. They are used when you have data about the response by organisations and people seeking to help those who need assistance.
								</li>
								<li>Crises, incidents and events: These include hashtags like #impact and #crisis. and
								</li>
								<li>General metadata: These include hashtags like #date and #status.

However, we often need to be able refine this hashtag to make it more precise (is the data about male or female people in need? adults or children? refugees or IDPs? in camp or self-hosted?).</p>
						<p class="text-small">Data providers may invent their own attributes to suit their local data needs. However, there are some recommended common attributes that will be useful across many data types. We will go over how to use the following to refine the meaning of a hashtag:
							<ol class="text-small">

It's important to note that age categories, in particular, tend to vary from country to country.

						<h4>Language Specific Tags</h4>

The HXL standard suggests reserving all two-character attributes for use as language codes, e.g. +ar for Arabic, +es for Spanish, +en for English, and +fr for French. You can then use those attributes to disambiguate columns with equivalent text in different languages, e.g. #description+fa for Dari and #description+ps for Pashto.</p>

						</div>
					</section>
					<section id="Rule 1" data-menu-title="Column Order" name="HXL Rules of the Road">
						<h4>Column Order Does Not Matter</h4>
						<p class="text-small">HXL tags label the column in your spreadsheet, which means that you can change the column order (or header names) without wreaking havoc in downstream workflows. In practice, this means that you can rearrange, remove or add extra columns to your spreadsheet. HXL-aware software will simply skip the columns it is not able to read.
						</p>
						<p class="text-small">This flexibility makes sharing data in spreadsheets more error resistant.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section id="Rule 1" data-menu-title="Header Names & Column Order" name="HXL Rules of the Road">
						<h4>HXL Tags Separate Headers from Data</h4>
						<p class="text-small">While HXL uses hashtags to label columns of data, it still allows you to include human-readable headers. The headers go before the row containing the hashtags. The data starts in the next row. You can include up to 24 rows of headers before the HXL hashtag row.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section id="Rule 1" data-menu-title="Header Names & Column Order" name="HXL Rules of the Road">
						<h4>You Can Change Header Names</h4>
						<p class="text-small">Just like with column order, making changes to the headers will not break any HXL-based processing as long as the HXL hashtags stay the same. This makes it possible to make your data interoperable without changing your existing workflows or data schemas while allowing you to retain the flexibility to change header names if you need to.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section id="Rule 1" data-menu-title="Multiple Columns for Multiple Values" name="HXL Rules of the Road">
						<h4>Use Multiple Columns for Data with Multiple Values</h4>
						<p class="text-small">Humanitarian data often contains more than one value for the same type of information. For example, an aid project might target two countries or involve two different organisations. In HXL, the preferred way to handle repetition is by repeating columns with the same hashtag, as many times as needed, as with #org in this example:
						</p>
					</section>
					<section id="Unique_tags" data-menu-title="Create your Own Tags" name="HXL Rules of the Road">
						<h4>Create your Own Tags</h4>
						<p class="text-small">The HXL core tags include tags that will be generally applicable to many humanitarian datasets, but it is impossible to anticipate every tag for every humanitarian need. If you do not find what you need in the core HXL hashtag and attribute dictionary, you can create your own hashtags starting with “x_”, such as #x_virulence or #x_risk. This standard makes the following four recommendations for extending HXL tags and attributes:
							<ul class="text-small">
								<li>Whenever possible, take an existing tag with a broader meaning, and narrow it down with an attribute, e.g. #loc+hospital.</li>
								<li>When there is no applicable core tag, begin an extension tag with “x_”, so that it will not conflict with any future HXL core hashtags, e.g. #x_toxicity.</li>
								<li>When software finds a HXL hashtag that it does not recognise, e.g. #x_toxicity, it should simply ignore the column of data.</li>
								<li>When software finds a HXL attribute that it does not recognise, e.g. #loc+hospital, it should ignore the attribute but still process the tag and any other attributes it does recognise: in this case, it should behave as if the dataset had contained simply #loc.</li>
							</ul>
